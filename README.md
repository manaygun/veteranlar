INTRODUCTION
Our objective in this data science project is to use advanced data preprocessing and exploration techniques to analyze a complex dataset and develop a machine learning model that produces accurate and logical outputs.

Our project involved working with a large and complex CSV file called "train.csv" (110.5MB) that contained a significant amount of irrelevant data. To prepare the data for analysis, we had to clean it up by removing redundant information, converting strings to integers by assigning numbers, and eliminating rows and columns with many missing values that wouldn't help our analysis. This step was crucial to ensure that the dataset was properly formatted and suitable for our purposes. By cleaning and transforming the data, we could create a more reliable and efficient machine-learning model that would produce accurate results.

In the project, we utilized various data visualization techniques to gain a deeper understanding of our dataset. By visualizing the columns and overall structure of the data, we were able to identify patterns, trends, and outliers that would have been difficult to detect through numerical analysis alone. These insights provided valuable guidance for our subsequent data preprocessing and modeling steps, helping us to develop a more accurate and effective machine learning model.
